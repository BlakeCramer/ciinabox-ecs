## Contributing guidelines


### Adding new actions

Currently all actions are implemented as Rake tasks, and wrapped using `bin/ciinabox-ecs.rb` cli handler.
Ciinabox name is set as last name of the action. If you are adding action that does not take ciinabox
as argument - such as initialisation tasks, you'll need to add exception for not requiring ciinabox name
for that task within CLI wrapper.


### Adding new services

- Add template in `templates/services/service_name.rb`


### Setting up travis builds and tests

Due travis limitation of secrets not being available in PR builds, cloudformation templates are not validated in PR
builds. However, you should still have them executed on your own forks in travis. To setup builds, add following secrets
in

- `AWS_REGION=us-east-1` - (or any other region you deem appropriate)
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` - your limited access key having only `cloudformation:ValidateTemplate` permissions
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - your limited access key having only `cloudformation:ValidateTemplate` permissions
