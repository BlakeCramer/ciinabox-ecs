## Contributing guidelines


### Adding new actions

Currently all actions are implemented as Rake tasks, and wrapped using `bin/ciinabox-ecs.rb` cli handler.
Ciinabox name is set as last name of the action. If you are adding action that does not take ciinabox
as argument - such as initialisation tasks, you'll need to add exception for not requiring ciinabox name
for that task within CLI wrapper.


### Adding new services

- Add template in `templates/services/service_name.rb`
